# graphs
Purpose of this program is to help me learn the different graphs of functions, more specifically, power functions with exponents n/m.
Naturally, the program must be able to graph and generate user inputted graphs. After that, the random graph generation can be created.

1st draft complete. 

Completed: 
- navigation mechanics
- simple graphing mechanics

Todo:
- infinite graph generation
- tidy up features (graphics, UI)
- impl better zooming in/out
- random generation of power functions for quizzing
